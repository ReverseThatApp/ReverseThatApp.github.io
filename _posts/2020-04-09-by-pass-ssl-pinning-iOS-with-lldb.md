title: Bypass SSL Pinning with LLDB in iOS app
---

Imagine that you want to inspect the app to see what's information exchange between mobile app and server, you can think about using simple proxy tools to sniff requests and responses or more advanced techniques such as a reverse binary file to see what are endpoints, parameters and response payloads... To starting SSL Pinning bypass series, this post will introduce how to leverage LLDB tools to disable SSL pinning in iOS apps

## Disclaimer
This post is for educational purposes only, please use it at your discretion and contact the app's author if you find issues. We will inspect an app name REDACTED. The figures during the post just for demonstrations, might not relevant to REDACTED app.

## Prerequisites
Below tools are used during this post:
- A jailbroken device.
- [Installing Burp's CA Certificate in an iOS Device](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841109-Mobile%20Set-up_iOS%20Device%20-%20Installing%20CA%20Certificate.html)
- [Configuring an iOS Device to Work With Burp](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841108-configuring-an-ios-device-to-work-with-burp)
- [Hopper Disassembler](https://www.hopperapp.com/download.html)
- [Setup LLDB environment](https://kov4l3nko.github.io/blog/2016-04-27-debugging-ios-binaries-with-lldb/)

## Overview
We want to know how REDACTED app exchange info with server, so let pick up Burp Suite as proxy tool to sniff requests. Launch Burp Suite and do some necessary setup as Prerequisites section.
Observe *HTTP history* tab in Burp Suite while launching the app, we don't see any requests that exchange player info or configuration, something looks wrong here. Normally when we launch the app, we should see some kind of requests to get app configuration or send player state (game apps)... An idea comes in our minds that this may be due to SSL Pinning employed in the app. 

If you don't know what is SSL Pinning, I suggest referring this detailed explanation article about [how SSL Pinning works](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ssl-pinning-in-ios-app/){:target="_blank"}. In short, SSL Pinning is a way for the client-side to verify whether the app communicates only with the designated server itself. 
When the app has SSL Pinning implemented, connect it via proxy server will not work because the client will think that proxy as a server, not a real one and it won't establish a connection to that proxy server (due to certificate/public key of that proxy server not match with the one bundled in the app), so no requests will be made and no records will be shown in *HTTP history* tab. To make app requests appear on this tab, we need to find a way to downgrade **https** requests to **http**. And when the app communicates by HTTP protocol, there no need for SSL Pinning evaluation and our Burp Suite proxy will easily Catch 'Em All. To double confirm this, let's do some analysis. ^_^

## Static Analysis
### Inspect .ipa resources
With the help of [Frida iOS Dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump){:target="_blank"} or [CrackerXI](https://forum.iphonecake.com/index.php?/topic/363020-crackerxi-gui-app-decryption-tool-for-ios-11-12-13/){:target="_blank"}, we can easily pull out **.ipa** file of REDACTED app on a jailbroken device, unzip **.ipa** and navigate to Payload/REDACTED.app folder. All of the app resources and binary files are inside this folder.

We know that there are 2 ways of doing SSL Pinning: **Pin the certificate** or **pin the public key**. Pin the certificate is the easier way of implementing SSL Pinning as the developer just needs to download the serverâ€™s certificate and bundle them in the app and at run time, the app will compare server-side certificate with the one bundled.

Normally the certificate files in iOS app will have **.cer** or **.der** extensions. This is `DER` encoding, you can refer this [article](https://www.ssls.com/knowledgebase/what-are-certificate-formats-and-what-is-the-difference-between-them/){:target="_blank"} for more details.
Open Terminal and navigate to inside of REDACTED.app then run this command to search for certificate files: `find . -name "*.cer"`
[![find certificate files]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/find-certificate-files.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/find-certificate-files.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 1: Find certificate files**<br/><br/>

As we can see, the certificate files are bundled in the app, so we can say mostly this app has SSL Pinning implemented - pin the certificate. In case you inspect the app and don't find any certificate files with this command, it might be the developer pinned the public key instead, you need to inspect the binary file. I will share it in another post.

That's fine now. Let's hunt look for the URLs that the app is using because this is the parameter that network frameworks will use to make requests like NSURLSession, AlamoFire, AFNetworking... just to name as a few.

### Hunt for base URL (https)
We are sure that the REDACTED app is using secure https endpoints to communicate with the server because if just HTTP then it will be shown in *HTTP history* tab. There are some places most developers prefer to put the base URLs of the app for reuse over the entire app:
- Info.plist in host app (REDACTED.app/Info.plist)
- Mach-O binary file in the host app (REDACTED.app/REDACTED)
- Info.plist or Mach-O file in the framework (the app has dedicated network frameworks, for ex. REDACTED.app/Frameworks/NetworkXYZ.framework/Info.plist, REDACTED.app/Frameworks/NetworkXYZ.framework/NetworkXYZ ...)

By starting search **https** string in that order using `strings` command - *strings  looks  for  ASCII  strings in a binary file or standard input.  strings is useful for identifying random object files and many other things*, we can find some outcomes in the REDACTED Mach-O file.
[![strings-find-https]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/strings-find-https.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/strings-find-https.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 2: Find base HTTPS endpoints**<br/><br/>

It looks like `https://redacted-backend.redacted.com` and `https://private-tournaments-api.redacted.com` are the ones suspicious. These might be the base URLs that the app will use and append with other URLs' path to make the requests. It's time to trace where these URLs string are used in the app. We might need the help of Hopper Disassembler.

### Trace references of base URLs - Hopper Disassembler
Now let level up our skillset of static analysis with Hopper Disassembler tool - the reverse engineering tool that lets you disassemble, decompile our app. In this case, we use Hopper to disassemble Mach-O file to assembly instructions (arm64 for this case) and find down the reference of https string.

Launch Hopper Disassembler app then drag and drop our REDACTED.app/REDACTED into Hopper and wait for a while for it to disassemble. When it finishes, switch to **Str** tab on the left panel and search for `https://` string, we can see it will show results the same as the one we used `strings` command.
Let click on the `https://redacted-backend.redacted.com/` on the left panel, it will show as below:
[![hopper-find-https]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/hopper-find-https.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/hopper-find-https.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 3: Find base HTTPS endpoints in Hopper Disassembler**<br/><br/>

Double click on `DATA XREF=cfstring_https___redacted_backend_redacted_com_` to find when it is referenced, it would navigate to new location with showing methods referenced to this string.
[![HTTPS string references in Hopper Disassembler]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/hopper-https-references.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/hopper-https-references.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 4: HTTPS string references in Hopper Disassembler**<br/><br/>

We can see that there is a method using this string: `-[BRBackendController init]`. If you ever developed Objective-C applications before you should be familiar with this syntax. For those who did not, let me make it short. This is objective-C class initialzers (a.k.a constructors). So in Swift language it would be same like this `BRBackendController.init()`. Let double click on this `-[BRBackendController init]` to navigate to where exactly it is used.
[![-[BRBackendController init]]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/BRBackendController-init.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/BRBackendController-init.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 5: -[BRBackendController init]**<br/><br/>

Please don't panic with these assembly instructions and give up, I promise I will explain right now what are they. Just look into it again you will see that the string is being referenced at address `0000000100038000` with assembly instruction `add x2, x2, #0x170` and nicely generated comment `; 0x1019c5170@PAGEOFF, @"https://redacted-backend.redacted.com/"`. Please note down this address `0000000100038000`, we will use this when debugging the app in the next sections.

### What is ARM64 instructions?
I won't explain everything about ARM64 instructions here but I will try to explain some basic instructions for the sake of this post so that you can continue to follow through (to be honest even now I still need to learn a lot about this powerful language, I recently got addicted to this and found it like a puzzle game to play).

First, what is assembly language? Let me quote this short explanation from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language){:target="_blank"}: *In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language), often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Because assembly depends on the* **machine code instructions***, every assembler has its own assembly language which is designed for exactly one specific* **computer architecture***.*
Let me break down there terms:
- **Machine code instructions**: Objective-C or Swift are high-level languages. Your Objective-C or Swift code is compiled into assembly language, which is low-level. This assembly is then assembled by an assembler into machine code so that the CPU can read (0s and 1s). You can open REDACTED file in any text editor, you will see machine code instructions
[![Machine code in Hexadecimal form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/mach-O-in-hex.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/mach-O-in-hex.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 6: Machine code in Hexadecimal form**<br/><br/>

- **Computer architecture**: It's CPU Architecture, for ex. `arm64` (is the current 64-bit ARM CPU architecture, as used since the iPhone 5S and later), `armv7s` (being used in Apple's A6 and A6X chips on iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPad 4), `armv7` (32-bit ARM CPU, as used in the A5 and earlier), `x86_64` (64-bit Intel - Simulator), `i386` (32-bit Intel - Simulator)
iOS devices use CPU based on [ARM architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture){:target="_blank"}. In my opinion, this is easy to read compare to [x86_64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language){:target="_blank"} instructions set.

- **Registers**: There is series of levels of memory. Those are close to the CPU are fastest. In a modern computer, these are typically something like: CPU registers > L1 cache > L2 cache > L3 cache > Main memory > HDD. The processor will use some internal memory storage locations, a.k.a registers. For ARM64, there are 32 general purpose registers and some special registers, please have a look below for more details and when it can be used.
[![registers]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/registers.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/registers.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 7: Registers**<br/><br/>
[![registers purpose]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/registers-purpose.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/registers-purpose.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 8: Registers purpose**<br/><br/>

- **Assembly instruction**: There are many commands (operation code - opcode), it's a single instruction that can be executed by the CPU. The general format can be considered as the **instruction**, followed by the **operands**: `Instruction Rd, Rn, Operand2` where **Instruction** is a command (MOV, SUB, ADD...), **Rd** is destination register, **Rn** is the register that is operated on, **Operand2** might be a register or immediate value (for ex. #0xff).

I think that would be enough, for now, I will explain more when we reach those instructions in the next section, debug app with LLDB.

## Dynamic Analysis
LLDB is fully integrated with XCode since XCode 5, so if you are an iOS developer you've already get familiar with it as a daily job. We can attach to the running process from XCode or Terminal, for this post I will run LLDB from the terminal and attach to running app on the jailbroken device. Assume you already setup debugserver on jailbroken device in **Prerequisites** section.

### Start debugserver
Let SSH to the jailbroken device, for my case, it would be like this: `ssh ipse_home`, for your case it would be `ssh root@your_device_ip_address`. You might need to key in when password prompts (default password is `alpine`). If you would like to debug on jailbroken device often, you can create an SSH shortcut in your `~/.ssh/config` file like this (more details you can reference this [post](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssh-shortcut){:target="_blank"} for how to setup) then you can SSH via shortcut instead. You also can [SSH Passwordless login using SSH Keygen](https://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/) if you manage to SSH more often.

[![SSH Shortcut]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/SSH-shortcut.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/SSH-shortcut.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 9: SSH Shortcut**<br/><br/>

After SSH into the jailbroken device, we will use `debugserver` to attach to the app and listen for connections from other machines then from our laptop we will launch `LLDB` to connect to `debugserver` for remote debugging. Let's do step by step.

From Terminal SSH into the device, then run this command: `debugserver 0.0.0.0:1234 -w "Executable file"`
- **Executable file** is the process name we want to attach (this value you need to get from `Info.plist` file).
- `0.0.0.0` is the IP range allows for other connections to connect (if you know the IP address of remote debugging machine then please specify that for secure).
- `1234` is port number (you can define any if you want). 
- `-w` argument is abbreviation of `--waitfor` which will wait for process to launch (if not launched yet) or attach immediately if it's been already launched.
[![debugserver]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/start-debugserver.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/start-debugserver.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 10: Start debugserver**<br/><br/>

Let assume you already configured the jailbroken device using Burp Suite proxy, the app was not started yet then start above `debugserver` command. Whenever you see the output `Waiting to attach to process`, it's time to launch our app from the jailbroken device and you can see from Terminal it will print out new message `Listening to port 1234 for a connection from 0.0.0.0...` which means that it attached successfully and waiting for a connection to debug.
[![debugserver attached process]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/debugserver-attached-proccess.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/debugserver-attached-proccess.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 11: debugserver attached process**<br/><br/>

### Launch LLDB
We will use LLDB as a standalone debugger for this post instead of LLDB debugger through XCode debugging feature (XCode console pane). So let have some fun with LLDB command line, why not?

Now let the fun begin. Open another tab of Terminal and run `lldb` command.
[![Start LLDB standalone]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/start-lldb-standalone.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/start-lldb-standalone.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 12: Start LLDB standalone**<br/><br/>

From `lldb` prompt, type `platform select remote-ios` then `process connect connect://192.168.1.113:1234` to attach into our app (process) via `debugserver` (just to remember `192.168.1.113` is the IP address of the jailbroken device). If we can attach to the process successfully, you will see this log in Terminal:
[![Start LLDB standalone]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-connected-to-debugserver.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-connected-to-debugserver.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 13: LLDB attached to process**<br/><br/>

In case `lldb` shows the SDK Path error or something, you might double-check if your device iOS version exists in XCode iOS DeviceSupport or not. You can refer this great [post](https://kov4l3nko.github.io/blog/2016-04-27-debugging-ios-binaries-with-lldb/#problems-and-solutions){:target="_blank"} to troubleshoot if issues.

You need to type these 2 above commands everytime you want to debug application in `lldb` prompt, to save time, LLDB allow to config commands can be loaded when `lldb` start. You just need to copy those 2 commands and put in `~/.lldbinit` will do. Here is my sample `~/.lldbinit` file:
[![~/.lldbinit]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldbinit.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldbinit.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 14: ~/.lldbinit**<br/><br/>

You can define `lldb` command alias here also, and it will take effect in `lldb` prompt. But there will be a problem here if you are an iOS developer because this file will also be applied for LLDB in XCode, which means when you debug an application in XCode it also load this init file and will cost you some more time to launch the application. 
To separate the configuration between LLDB standalone and LLDB of XCode, you can create a new `~/.lldbinit-Xcode` file and put your commands there just for XCode usage. Whenever you debug application via XCode, it will check if `~/.lldbinit-Xcode` file if exists then XCode will load this file instead of `~/.lldbinit`.

### Set breakpoints
Now, `lldb` attached to the app process and waiting for us to debug, you might notice that the app is hanging on the jailbroken device because the process is being interrupted. The debug process would be the same as we debug in XCode except in XCode you debug through each line of code, here you debug each line of assembly instruction, and you examine registers instead of variables.
Before examining registers, let set a breakpoint first. Go back to Hopper Disassembler, go to address `0000000100038000` of `-[BRBackendController init]` method, we need to set the breakpoint at this address to see if application will invoke this method or not and examine value of URL string passed to the registers (in Hopper Disassembler, press `G` then put in address value to navigate to). In LLDB, to set breakpoint at an address we can type: `breakpoint set --address 0x0000000100038000`, or `br s -a 0x0000000100038000` for short then enter.	
[![LLDB set breakpoint failed]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-set-breakpoint-failed.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-set-breakpoint-failed.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 15: LLDB set breakpoint failed**<br/><br/>

But look at that warning, it failed to set breakpoint at `0x0000000100038000`. Why??? The reason it's failed because of **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)**. [ASLR is a memory-protection process for operating systems (OSes) that guards against buffer-overflow attacks by randomizing the location where system executables are loaded into memory.](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/address-space-layout-randomization-ASLR). We need to calculate the real address when the process is running to set a breakpoint (we need to re-calculate real address every time we start the app). `Real Address = ASLR shift + Hopper Address`, let find out missing part `ASLR Shift`.

From `lldb` prompt, type `image list -o processName` then enter, the result in the console is the `ASLR shift` (please note that the value might not the same for you as it's a random number).

[![ASLR Shift]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/ASLR-shift.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/ASLR-shift.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 16: ASLR Shift**<br/><br/>

My case `ASLR Shift = 0x00000000045bc000`, so `Real Address = ASLR shift + Hopper Address = 0x00000000045bc000+0x0000000100038000 = 0x1045F4000`. Let set breakpoint again: `br s -a 0x00000000045bc000+0x0000000100038000` or `br s -a 0x1045F4000` then enter.
[![Set breakpoint successfully]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/set-breakpoint-successfully.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/set-breakpoint-successfully.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 17: Set breakpoint successfully**<br/><br/>

We just set breakpoint succesfully, now let the process continue to run by typing: `continue` or `c` then enter. It will run the app for a second then you will see it will stop again in console, IT HITS THE BREAKPOINT!!!!
[![LLDB hits breakpoint]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-hit-breakpoint.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-hit-breakpoint.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 18: LLDB hits breakpoint**<br/><br/>

### Examine registers
You can see process stopped at our breakpoint (at address `0x1045F4000`) at instruction `add x2, x2, #0x170`. Let have a look again in Hopper Disassembler for these instructions:
[![Instructions explanation]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/BRBackendController-init-explanation.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/BRBackendController-init-explanation.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 19: Instructions explanation**<br/><br/>

I put comment for those instructions, the `add x2, x2, #0x170` can be translated as `x2 = x2 + #0x170 = #0x1019c5000 + #0x170 = 0x1019c5170`, this is address of `https://redacted-backend.redacted.com` (you can look back above **Figure 4**) and Hopper Disassembler is smart enough to find out and put comment at the end of this instruction. So after executing this instruction, we expect value of x2 is `https://redacted-backend.redacted.com`. Let type `next` or `n` then enter to execute this instruction.

Now to check value of register x2, you can type `po $x2` (po is print object) or `register read x2`, you will see register `x2` now holding address that contains string `https://redacted-backend.redacted.com`
[![Instructions explanation]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-examine-register-x2.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-examine-register-x2.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 20: Examine register x2**<br/><br/>

### Change registers value
As we are in debug mode, to change value of register is trivial. We want to downgrade `https` to `http` protocol so we need to change value of register `x2` from `https://redacted-backend.redacted.com` to `http://redacted-backend.redacted.com`, let do it:
- First, let create new `http://redacted-backend.redacted.com` string by: `expression @"http://redacted-backend.redacted.com"` or `e @"http://redacted-backend.redacted.com"`, it will spit out new string created with address of that string in memory. As below, `0x00000001c0c63740` is address of new string for my case:
[![Create new string]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-create-new-string.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/lldb-create-new-string.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 21: Create new string**<br/><br/>

- Next, we need to set register `x2` to hold new value by: `register write x2 0x00000001c0c63740` and examine its value again, we can see `x2` now reflected new value.
[![Change register x2 to new value]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/change-register-x2-value.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/change-register-x2-value.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 22: Change register x2 to new value**<br/><br/>

- Finally, just type `c` to resume application so it will continue to run with new URL endpoint, the process no longer hit the breakpoint and look into Hopper Disassembler we can see all of `http://redacted-backend.redacted.com` endpoints are shown in *HTTP History* tab with requests and 
responses details, MISSION COMPLETED!!!
[![Change register x2 to new value]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/hopper-sniff-http-requests.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/br/hopper-sniff-http-requests.png){:target="_blank"} <br/>**Figure 23: Hopper Disassembler can see applications requests & responses**<br/><br/>

## Final thought
- SSL Pinning only work with `https` protocol, so to downgrade to `http` requests we can bypass easily
- REDACTED server supports both `http` and `https` protocol so the app works normally when downgraded to `http`
- For servers that does not support `http` protocol, this kind SSL Pinning by pass will not work, but we can have our proxy to redirect `http` to `https` so it will work (client send `http` request to proxy -> proxy rewrite `http` to `https` request and send to server)
- LLDB is very powerful!! Play with registers is an advanced skill we can learn. You can do anything as long as you can attach a debugger into running app.
- This app doesn't have jailbreak and anti-debug detection, so we can do whatever we want without limitation. If you want to secure the app, you need to think about employing this dectection in your codes.
