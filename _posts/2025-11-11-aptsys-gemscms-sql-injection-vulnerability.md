## Summary

A **SQL Injection** vulnerability was identified in Aptsys’ **gemscms** backend platform, a shared backend used by multiple F&B businesses for POS and restaurant management.  
A vulnerable backend API that accepts a restaurant identifier parameter allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary SQL statements against the application database. This can lead to data leakage, unauthorized modification, or full database compromise.

> CVE: **CVE-2025-52025** (*Reserved - pending public publication*)  
> This public advisory serves as the official reference for CVE publication.  
> Technical exploitation details, payloads, and live data are intentionally withheld to reduce risk to end users.

## Background & Discovery

The vulnerability was discovered incidentally in **May 2025** during normal use of a mobile client application that communicates with the Aptsys gemscms backend.  
The same backend platform is shared among multiple Aptsys-powered client deployments across the F&B sector. Independent verification confirmed a remote SQL injection condition affecting connected backend instances.

Attempts to responsibly disclose the issue to the vendor were made through multiple channels between **May–Nov 2025**, but no remediation or formal acknowledgment was received.

## Affected Product(s)

- **Vendor:** [Aptsys](http://aptsys.com.sg/)  
- **Product:** Aptsys gemscms POS Platform (backend) — used by multiple F&B clients  
- **Component:** A backend service API that retrieves service/restaurant-related data (specific function and file path withheld for security reasons)  
- **Confirmed Affected:** Production environment verified in May 2025  
- **Versions:** Unknown (likely affects multiple active backend deployments)

---

## Vulnerability Details (Redacted)

An **SQL Injection** vulnerability exists in a service data retrieval API of the Aptsys gemscms backend.  
User-supplied input for a restaurant identifier parameter is incorporated into an SQL query without adequate sanitization or use of parameterized queries. A remote attacker can submit crafted input to alter SQL semantics, resulting in execution of arbitrary SQL on the database.

This may enable attackers to:
- Extract sensitive database contents (user records, credentials, payment details)  
- Modify or delete data in the database  
- Escalate to administrative control over the database server

> **Note:** Exact parameter names, SQL payload examples, and PoC requests are intentionally omitted from this public advisory to avoid enabling malicious actors.

---

## Exploitation (High-Level)

- **Attack vector:** Remote (HTTP request)  
- **Authentication required:** None  
- **Complexity:** Low  

An attacker can submit malicious input through the vulnerable parameter to manipulate the underlying SQL query and achieve unauthorized read/write behavior in the database.

---

## Impact

- Unauthenticated execution of arbitrary SQL statements against the application database  
- Unauthorized data disclosure, modification, or deletion  
- Potential full database compromise and subsequent backend takeover  
- Increased risk due to the multi-tenant nature of the backend (affecting multiple client deployments)

---

## Mitigation & Recommendations

### For Operators / Administrators

1. **Restrict public access** to backend endpoints that accept user-controlled parameters (move behind VPN or internal networks).  
2. **Monitor and log** suspicious requests containing SQL control characters or unusual payload lengths.  
3. **Deploy WAF rules** to detect and block common SQL injection patterns.  
4. **Back up** databases regularly and verify integrity of backups.  
5. **Rotate database credentials** and apply least-privilege database accounts.  
6. **Perform full security review** of any endpoints accepting user input.

### For Developers / Vendor

- Use **parameterized queries** / prepared statements or ORM query builders instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL.  
- Implement strict **input validation** and whitelisting for all parameters.  
- Conduct code audits of server-side components handling query construction (especially modules that process identifiers).  
- Add centralized logging and alerts for anomalous database queries.  
- Release and distribute patched backend versions to customers promptly.

## Withheld Information

To reduce risk of exploitation, the following are intentionally omitted from this public advisory:

- Concrete SQL payloads or request samples  
- Live or production server URLs  
- Proof-of-concept scripts or automation details  
- Exact function names, file paths, or internal schema details

Operators of Aptsys gemscms deployments should treat this as a high-severity issue and apply mitigations immediately. Vendors and CERT teams may contact the reporter for full technical details.
